# St. Clarence Montessori 
This website is for educational purposes only.
There are many different Montessori schoolâ€™s. They are all somewhat in competition with each other so the website has to explain why the school is the best. This website also takes the time to explain to parents what a Montessori school is in case they do not know. 
The website has a simplified interface so that parents/adults of any age are able to easily and effectively navigate to what they need.

## UX
This website is for parents that want their child to have a special type of education. Or for those who would like to donate to the organization.

## User Stories
1. I am a parent and I want to know what a montessori school it.
- Navigate from the home page and press about us. Or on the home page under the "New Students" area the learn more button leads to the about page. There is information about what a montessori school it.
2. I am a parent and I want to know what the school year will be like for my child.
- On the home page there is a direct link to the academic calendar
3. I am a parent and I want to know what programs are provided.
- On the home page under the "Our Programs" area the learn more button leads to the programs page
4. I am a parent and I want to schedule a tour
-On the hero image a link to schedule a tour is shown on every page of the website
5. I am a parent and I have a question
-Use the navigation bar and go to the contact us page- the schedule tour button also leads here
I made things easier by having the home page lead to the correct destination just in case the adult/parent scrolls down before using the navigation bar.
## Features
The website has a about us page, prospective students page, contact page, and the home page which gives links to the academic calendar and the students page and the about us page.
The website is simple and easy to navigate. It is also responsive. 
1.  Wireframes 
- Located within the assets/pdf-files folder. Some of the wireframe elements have been changed such as the title of the site and elements on each page but it was used as the blueprint

## Features Left to Implement

1. A donation feature
- This feature was not added due to time and my knowledge. The reason why this feature is important is because there are many Montessori schools that are nonprofit and depend on donations to fund all of their needs. These funds are also used to provide scholarships to families that face financial hardship. This is important to include because I am a firm supporter of nonprofits and I want my website to represent something I firmly believe in so that maybe I can use this as an example and I can create a website such as this for a future nonprofit employer.
2. Social media icons
- I could not figure out how to get the sticky social icon element that I wanted to use to work. It would either look fine on web or fine on mobile but not on both. I'd rather have a site that works than adding elements that do not function correctly at this time.
3. Privacy policy/terms of service
- This element is important to me because I want this website to work as a nonprofit. So since I would be accepting donations I believe it would be wise to have links to these two pages.

## Technologies Used
1. [JQuery](https://www.jqueryscript.net/) 
- jquery was used with boostrap to make sure the navigation bar functioned correctly
2. [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
- boostrap was used for the navigation bar, section layout of the pages, and for the site responsiveness.
3. [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) 
- css was used to stylize the site
4. [HTML](https://html.com/) 
-html was used to build the bones of the site

## Testing
HTML Tested with https://validator.w3.org/ - Error occured. There is an error reguarding my button that I made as an element of <a>. It is not correct but it functions.
CSS Tested with https://jigsaw.w3.org/ - No errors found in my css code
Incorrect code used class ="button"
